    "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "true_answer": "18",

    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "raw_output": "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, which totals 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used daily. \n\nThe number of eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.\n\nShe sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18 per day at the farmers' market. \n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.",
