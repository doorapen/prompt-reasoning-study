    "question": "The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?",

    "raw_output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can stand from the dragon while still being able to hit it with the gold javelin, given the increased throwing distance when holding the sapphire gemstone.\n\n1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance without the gemstone:**\n   - Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.\n\n2. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**\n   - When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.\n   - Therefore, with the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin \\(3 \\times 400 = 1200\\) feet.\n\n3. **Determine the reach of the dragon's flames:**\n   - The dragon can breathe fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.\n\n4. **Calculate the safe distance for Polly to stand:**\n   - Polly needs to be outside the reach of the dragon's flames to be safe, which means she must stand more than 1000 feet away from the dragon.\n   - Since she can throw the javelin 1200 feet with the gemstone, she can stand up to 1200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it.\n   - To be outside the reach of the flames, Polly should stand at a distance greater than 1000 feet but less than or equal to 1200 feet.\n\n5. **Calculate the maximum safe distance:**\n   - The maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon while still being able to hit it is 1200 feet.\n   - The minimum safe distance to avoid the flames is 1000 feet.\n\nTherefore, Polly can stand anywhere between 1000 and 1200 feet from the dragon. The farthest she can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon is 200 feet (1200 feet - 1000 feet).\n\nThe analysis is mostly correct, but let's clarify the final answer:\n\n1. **Polly's Throwing Distance with the Gemstone:** Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet when holding the sapphire gemstone.\n\n2. **Dragon's Flame Reach:** The dragon can breathe fire up to 1000 feet.\n\n3. **Safe Distance for Polly:** Polly needs to be more than 1000 feet away to be safe from the dragon's flames.\n\n4. **Maximum Distance Polly Can Stand:** Polly can stand up to 1200 feet away and still hit the dragon.\n\nTherefore, Polly can safely stand anywhere between just over 1000 feet and 1200 feet from the dragon.
