Since the blue fiber requirement is 2 bolts, half of that is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Bolts Calculation**: Add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ bolts of blue fiber} + 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber} = 3 \\text{ bolts in total}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes a total of 3 bolts to make the robe.\n\nThe calculation and reasoning provided are correct.
