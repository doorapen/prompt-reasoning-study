    "question": "When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes that she uses contains three tomatoes. Freda\u2019s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?",
    "true_answer": "12",
    "prompt_type": "self_reflection",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "raw_output": "To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the volume reduction**: When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the final volume of the sauce is half the initial volume of the canned tomatoes.\n\n2. **Calculate the initial volume of tomatoes**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. Since the sauce is half the volume of the original canned tomatoes, the initial volume of the canned tomatoes must have been twice the volume of the sauce. Therefore, the initial volume is:\n   \\[\n   32 \\text{ ounces (sauce)} \\times 2 = 64 \\text{ ounces (initial volume of tomatoes)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, divide the total initial volume by the volume of one can:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{64 \\text{ ounces}}{16 \\text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \\text{ cans}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the number of tomatoes**: Each can contains three tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ cans} \\times 3 \\text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \\text{ tomatoes}\n   \\]\n\nThus, Freda used 12 tomatoes to make her last batch of tomato sauce.\n\nThe solution provided is correct. Freda used 12 tomatoes to make her last batch of tomato sauce. Here's a quick recap of the reasoning:\n\n1. The sauce's final volume is 32 ounces, which is half the initial volume of the canned tomatoes. Therefore, the initial volume of the canned tomatoes was 64 ounces.\n\n2. Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, so Freda used 4 cans to reach 64 ounces (64 ounces \u00f7 16 ounces per can = 4 cans).\n\n3. Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so Freda used a total of 12 tomatoes (4 cans \u00d7 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes).\n\nFinal Answer: Freda used 12 tomatoes.",
