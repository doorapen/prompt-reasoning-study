    "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",

    "raw_output": "Thought: First, I need to determine how many eggs Janet has left to sell after she uses some for breakfast and baking. She starts with 16 eggs each day.\n\nAction: Compute[16 - 3 - 4]\n\nThought: Janet uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking, which totals 7 eggs. Subtracting these from the 16 eggs laid each day will give the number of eggs she has left to sell.\n\nAction: Compute[16 - 7]\n\nThought: Janet has 9 eggs left to sell at the farmers' market each day. Each egg is sold for $2.\n\nAction: Compute[9 * 2]\n\nThought: By multiplying the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg, I can find out how much money she makes each day at the farmers' market.\n\nAnswer: Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.",
