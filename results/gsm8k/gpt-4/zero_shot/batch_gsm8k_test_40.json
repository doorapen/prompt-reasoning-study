    "question": "The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?",
    "true_answer": "200",
    "prompt_type": "zero_shot",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "raw_output": "When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal distance. Normally, she can throw the javelin 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, she can throw it:\n\n\\[ 400 \\text{ feet} \\times 3 = 1200 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThe dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the reach of the flames from the distance she can throw the javelin:\n\n\\[ 1200 \\text{ feet} - 1000 \\text{ feet} = 200 \\text{ feet} \\]\n\nThus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.",
