    "question": "Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. How many girls are not in the girl scout?",
    "true_answer": "40",

    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "raw_output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of girls who are not in the girl scout.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many boys are in Grade 5. According to the problem, 2/5 of the 200 students are boys:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of boys} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 200 = 80\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120\n\\]\n\nNow, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, we calculate the number of girls in the girl scout:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Girls in girl scout} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 120 = 80\n\\]\n\nFinally, to find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Girls not in girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 40 girls are not in the girl scout.",

    "question": "When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Each 16 ounce can of tomatoes that she uses contains three tomatoes. Freda\u2019s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?",
    "true_answer": "12",
    "prompt_type": "zero_shot",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "raw_output": "To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to work through the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the volume change**: When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means the final volume of the sauce is half the initial volume of the canned tomatoes.\n\n2. **Final volume of sauce**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.\n\n3. **Initial volume of canned tomatoes**: Since the sauce loses half its volume during cooking, the initial volume of the canned tomatoes must have been twice the final volume of the sauce. Therefore, the initial volume is:\n   \\[\n   32 \\text{ ounces} \\times 2 = 64 \\text{ ounces}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Volume per can**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces.\n\n5. **Number of cans used**: To find out how many cans were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, divide the total initial volume by the volume per can:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{64 \\text{ ounces}}{16 \\text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \\text{ cans}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Tomatoes per can**: Each can contains three tomatoes.\n\n7. **Total number of tomatoes used**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ cans} \\times 3 \\text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \\text{ tomatoes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.",
