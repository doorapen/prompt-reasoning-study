    "answer": "18",
    "reasoning": "Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market each day.\n\n1. **Total eggs laid per day:**\n   Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n\n2. **Eggs consumed by Janet:**\n   She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.\n\n3. **Eggs used for baking muffins:**\n   She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day.\n\n4. **Eggs remaining for sale:**\n   To find the number of eggs left to sell, subtract the eggs she consumes and uses for baking from the total eggs laid:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ eggs} - 3 \\text{ eggs} - 4 \\text{ eggs} = 9 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Daily earnings from selling eggs:**\n   She sells the remaining eggs at $2 per egg. So, her daily earnings are:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ eggs} \\times \\$2/\\text{egg} = \\$18\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is: \\$18"
