She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "true_answer": "18",
    "prompt_type": "zero_shot",
    "model": "deepseek-r1",
    "answer": "18",
    "reasoning": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market.\n\n1. **Total eggs laid per day:**\n   Janet's ducks lay **16 eggs** per day.\n\n2. **Eggs consumed for breakfast:**\n   Janet eats **3 eggs** for breakfast every morning.\n\n3. **Eggs used for muffins:**\n   She uses **4 eggs** to bake muffins for her friends every day.\n\n4. **Remaining eggs for sale:**\n   To find the number of eggs left to sell, subtract the eggs used for breakfast and muffins from the total eggs laid:\n   \\[\n   16 \\text{ eggs} - 3 \\text{ eggs} - 4 \\text{ eggs} = 9 \\text{ eggs}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Daily earnings from selling eggs:**\n   Janet sells the remaining eggs for **\\$2 per egg**. So, her daily earnings are:\n   \\[\n   9 \\text{ eggs} \\times \\$2/\\text{egg} = \\$18\n   \\]\n\n**Therefore, the answer is: 18**"
